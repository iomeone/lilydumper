For example, on the following example, the first stave is named \"Pit\" and the second one \"Herr\" Showing names for staves I wanted to reuse these names (thus extract them from the music sheet) in the select part window. Note: I didn't implemented the \"select part\" option in the player. To do so, I simply got them from the event listener. We already saw how we got the staff number, when receiving a note head event. Lilypond also provides a function get-instrument-name which can be called at the same place. That way, it is possible to know which name (if any) correspond to a specific staff number, and therefore provide the functionality of letting the user select a part of music by the instrument name. The code look as follow: #(define (save-staff-number-instrument-name staff-number context) (output-to-table-file (ly:format \"~a ~a\" staff-number (get-instrument-name context)))) #(define (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver) (let* ((context (ly:translator-context source-engraver)) (root-context (object-address (ly:context-property-where-defined context 'instrumentName))) (staff-number (get-staff-number root-context)) (save-staff-number-instrument-name staff-number context) ...\n))) \\layout { \\context { \\Voice \\consists #(make-engraver (acknowledgers ((note-head-interface engraver grob source-engraver) (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver)))) }\n} In hindsight, this part was probably useless, because no ones ever set the names of these staves in a music sheet."},"issue_with_repeated_notes.html#separating-repeated-notes":{"title":"Separating repeated notes","breadcrumbs":"Finding when notes are played » Separating repeated notes","body":"The following music sheet: one note repeated twice means that: at the very beginning of the song, that is at \\( t=0s \\), a pianist must press the la key. at \\( t=0.6s \\), he must release the la key and immediately press it again at \\( t=1.2s \\), he must release the la key. Releasing a key and pressing it again at the exact same time is something that is literraly impossible to do for a human being. However, for a computer this lead to the situation where a sound is emitted but it doesn't look like the key was pressed again. Let's look at the following video, and let's pay extra attention to the la key displayed on the keyboard at the bottom. It looks like it is pressed at the beginning and released at the end only, while in the middle of the video we can distinctly hear the la note being played again. The key on the keyboard looks like it is pressed only once When looking at the keyboard only, it looks like the la key is played once and held as if it was a white note, not a quarter one. To overcome this issue, the program applies a similar strategies as the one used to fix \"overlapping\" notes. It will detect when a note is said to be released and pressed at the exact same time, and it will then introduce a small temporal gap. This mimick human's behaviour. The first note will be released slightly earlier. Its duration will be shorter by either 1/4 of its duration, or 75 milli seconds, whichever is smaller. These values where chosen completely arbitrarily though. The result is the following video where one can clearly spot when is second la played only by looking at the keyboard.

One solution here could be to always say on which page should a cursor be printed. However that would be wasteful as the page doesn't change often. Therefore instead of always setting the page to the current one, the page will only be selected when there is a turn page event. Detecting a turn page is simple. When playing the music, if two consecutive cursor are on two different pages, there must be a turn-page event inserted. The new page is the one of the second cursor.

For example, in case of a repeated part that starts at the bottom of a page and finishes at the top of the next one.

It is meant to facilitate writing music editors. For example, the Frescobaldi software provides a music sheet view and a text editor view as can be seen on the following screenshot: Frescobaldi screenshot when the user click on a note on the music sheet, the software automatically moves the cursor on the left side to the corresponding place in the source file.

These are respectively the line column number in the source file. And these lines are what was used to find out when to play a note. As a consequence, this point and click can be used to correlate the place in the music sheet a note is, such that when a note is to be played, it can also be graphically highlighted. Now the idea is thus to extract all the \"point and click\" and their bounding boxes in all pages. Lilypond produces pdf files by default, however parsing pdf files to extract this data proved to require significant efforts. Instead of working with pdf files, I used another output format provided by lilypond: svg. Svg files are a special \"kind\" of xml files and therefore can easily be analysed with a text editor or worked on with any XML parser. To get lilypond to output svg files, one had to pass the -dbackend=svg option to lilypond. This will generate one file per page, and to ensure lilypond generates these precious point-and-click elements, one has to also pass the -dpoint-and-click option. The result when doing so is an svg file containing cross link. For a note, the svg file will contain for example <a style=\"color:inherit;\" xlink:href=\"textedit:///tmp/simple_overlapping_notes.ly:36:17:18\">\n<path transform=\"translate(39.4689, 10.3826) scale(0.0028, -0.0028)\" d=\"M211 141c61 0 117 -33 117 -100c0 -71 -52 -121 -99 -149c-34 -20 -73 -33 -112 -33c-61 0 -117 33 -117 100c0 71 52 121 99 149c34 20 73 33 112 33z\" fill=\"currentColor\"/>\n</a> From this, we can extract that the note that is written at line 36 from character 17 to 18 in the file /tmp/simple_overlapping_notes.ly stays at position 39.4689, 10.3826 in the svg file. And to compute the bounding box, we need to properly decode the content of the d field in the path element. That last part requires significant effort. So instead, I went for a different method, albeit similar in design. Lilypond provides ways to modify properties of graphical objects. When using the event-listener it is possible to automatically modify the note head for all notes as they appear on the music sheet. However we are not interested in modifying how the notes look like on the music sheet. What we want is to extract the bounding boxes of notes in the music sheet. By abusing the id properties of notes, we can achieve such a thing. The code in the event-listener looks as follow: #(define (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver) (let* ((context (ly:translator-context source-engraver)) (event (event-cause grob)) ... (ly:grob-set-property! grob 'id origin)\n)) %%%% The actual engraver definition: We just install some listeners so we\n%%%% are notified about all notes and rests. We don't create any grobs or\n%%%% change any settings. \\layout { \\override NoteHead.stencil = #(lambda (grob) (let* ((note (ly:note-head::print grob)) (former-id (ly:grob-property-data grob 'id)) (x-interval (ly:stencil-extent note X)) (x-width (interval-length x-interval)) (y-interval (ly:stencil-extent note Y)) (y-height (interval-length y-interval)) (new-values (format #f \"#x-width=~1,4f#y-height=~1,4f\" x-width y-height)) (new-id (string-append new-values former-id))) (ly:grob-set-property! grob 'id new-id) note)) \\context { \\Voice \\consists #(make-engraver (acknowledgers ((note-head-interface engraver grob source-engraver) (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver)))) }\n} This code adds the origin of a note (the position in the source file) and also the x-width and y-height of the note in svg into the note id. When running Lilypond with this, we now get something like <g id=\"#x-width=.9284#y-height=.7971#origin=simple_overlapping_notes.ly:36:17:20#...\">\n<path transform=\"translate(39.4689, 10.3826) scale(0.0028, -0.0028)\" d=\"M211 141c61 0 117 -33 117 -100c0 -71 -52 -121 -99 -149c-34 -20 -73 -33 -112 -33c-61 0 -117 33 -117 100c0 71 52 121 99 149c34 20 73 33 112 33z\" fill=\"currentColor\"/>\n</g> We can now extract that there is a note at position 39.4689, 10.3826 which spans for 0.9284, 0.7971 and that originates from simple_overlapping_notes.ly:36:17 . The position is actually the center of the note on the y axis, and the leftmost position on the x axis. With this knowledge, computing the bounding box limits comes quite easy Extracting all the g elements with an id field, and doing so for all svg files, we can now get where notes are displayed, and identify them. And since that id is the same one as written in the note files (the output of the event listener), it is then possible to match notes being played to where they are displayed. Now there is an issue with unfold repeats here. If the user has some unfolded repeats in his source file, one note will appear several time in the music sheet, but have only one distinct id (i.e. line and column number) in the source file. For these cases, the software can't do the mapping and will therefore print an error message. A user can simply copy/paste the repeated part as many times as required to provide the same graphical output while having one source note matching one note in the music sheet. The same issue arises when a user uses variables and refer to them several times in the lilypond file.","id":"matching_a_note_to_where_it_appears.html#matching-notes-to-where-they-appear-on-the-music-sheet","breadcrumbs":"Finding where the cursor should be » Matching notes to where they appear on the music sheet."},"file_format.html#mapping-staff-number-instrument-name":{"id":"file_format.html#mapping-staff-number-instrument-name","breadcrumbs":"Mapping staff number, instrument name","body":"Immediately follwoing the header, comes the instrument names mapping as described in its own chapter .

Let's look at the following example to understand what the issue actually is: simple music sheet with tied notes This music sheet means that the la key must be pressed only once, and for a total of 1.2s (two quarter time) However, when simply using the default event listener, the output we get is as follow: 0.00000000\ttempo\t400.00000000\n0.00000000\tnote\t69\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 4 36\n0.00000000\ttie\n0.25000000\tnote\t69\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 11 36 The event listener generates lines per ... event, and on the music sheet there are two notes, hence two lines. Instead of saying there should only be one key pressed, it says the key should be pressed twice, which is wrong. My first approach to tackle this issue was to use the midi file. Lilypond can generate a midi file alongside the music sheet. As a rough estimate approximation, a midi file is akin to an mp3 file but for instrument music only. Since lilypond generates midi file that correctly describes how the music is played, it would be possible to know if a key is played longer than what is described in the events file, and thus if it is tied to the next key with the same pitch. This lead me to develop pianoterm . However some issues with this approach quickly appeared. When playing triolet for example, there is a slight difference in the timings outputed in the events file and the one in the midi files due to some rounding in the midi file. This could be easily fixed by correlating the timings, however this approach looked a bit too britle hence I looked for something else. On the generated events above, we can see there is a tie event. We could use this as it means the previous note has a tie attached, but sadly this is not precise enough. For example, the following two equivalents music sheets provides the following two different events: music sheet lilypond source generated events tied_notes_chord_1 <la' sol'>4~ <la' sol'> tied_notes_chord_2 <sol' la'>4~ <sol' la'> On the first first music sheet, looking at the generated events only, it looks like the tie applies to the sol key, whereas on the second one it looks like it applies to the la key. Truth is, both the sol and la key have a tie attached. For an even more contrived example, the two following distinct music sheets give the same tie events (as seen per the event-listener) music sheet Source generated events tied notes_with_same_tie_events1 <sol' la'~ mi''>4~ <sol' la' mi''>4 tied notes_with_same_tie_events2 <sol' la' mi''>4~ la' One solution to overcome this issue would be to get on each line corresponding to a note, something saying if yes or no there is a tie attached to that note. Since Lilypond provides the option to let the user include file for global settings, I used it to extract more data from the event-listener than the default one. That is, I created a file named event-listener.scm with this content and then called lilypond using lilypond -dinclude-settings=event-listener.scm <music-sheet.ly> . The following table shows the new event-listener's output: music sheet source generated events tied_notes_chord_1 <la' sol'>4~ <la' sol'> tied_notes_chord_2 <sol' la'>4~ <sol' la'> Sadly, on these generated events, it says no notes have a tie attached. On a positive side we can say that at least we got some consistency here. Two different inputs which are logically equivalent now generates the same output, One way to workaround the issue, is to rewrite the music sheet to explicitly say that each note on the chord has a tie attached instead of saying the whole chord has a tie attached. Below show the difference in writing the input, and the generated output. music sheet source generated events separately_tied_notes_chord <la'~ sol'~>4 <la' sol'> separately_tied_notes_chord2 <sol' la'~ mi''>4 la' separately_tied_notes_chord3 <sol'~ la'~ mi''~>4 <sol' la' mi''>4 Now we properly get for each note if there is a tie attached to it. This solution is not satisfactory as it requires modifying by hand the input music sheet, but sadly I could not find anything better yet."},"possible_improvements.html#possible-improvements":{"id":"possible_improvements.html#possible-improvements","title":"Possible improvements","breadcrumbs":"Possible improvements","body":"Like most software, there is always something more that can be done.

That is the exact same events as generated simple music sheet without any repeat This issue here is due to the fact that the default event-listener doesn't pay attention to repeat events. I tried modifying it in several ways so that it would also report on repeat events. However I could not get what was repeated which is quite important to say the least. if we have the following music sheet, \\repeat volta 2 { la' sol' } We need to extract that this is equivalent to la' sol' la' sol' . With my several attempts based only on the event-listener, I was getting the following events.: t=0 play la' duration quarter-time\nt=quarter-time play sol' duration quarter-time\nt=2 * quarter-time display-repeat-bar This is not good enough, as the same output was produced for this different music: la' \\repeat volta 2 { sol' } which is equivalent to la' sol' sol' .

Therefore I just ignore them. However, when focusing on volta and unfold repeat, we see on the generated events that unfolded repeats produce the correct events about notes being played and when. Therefore when encoutering a volta repeat, one can simply change it to an unfold ed one to get the right music events. This leads to another issue though. It changes the generated output. One goal of the project was to work on real music sheets, just like the ones a pianist would use. Not a simplified equivalent one. This issue will be treated later on, in the part about matching a note to where it appears on the music sheet . For now, to solve the current issue due to repeats, let's just replace all volta repeats by unfold repeats. There are several ways to do so. Since lilypond's input file are simply text files, one way would be to programmatically edit the text to replace volta by unfold everywhere it appears, and then start processing the music sheet. Another way would be to modify lilypond so that every time it encounters a volta repeat it would treat it just like an unfold one. I went for the second solution as it is the most stable one as modifying the source would lead to other issues later on. Reading lilypond's source code, I found the place where it decide how to treat a repeat . simply changing VoltaRepeatedMusic by UnfoldedRepeatedMusic . Modifying lilypond implies recompiling it, which also implies having the right compile-time dependencies and other inconveniences. Fortunately, the file requiring the modification is actually interpreted, hence simply modifying and re-running lilypond is enough.

Therefore to achieve the goal of discriminating notes from being played left or right, one idea would simply be to try to use the debug skylines again. Using these, it would be possible to graphically find out on which staff a note is drawn, and consequently if it is the first or second staff of the system, and therefore if it should be played with the left or right hand. See for example the following piece of music. Skylines can be used to tell on which staff a note is However, a different solution was used here. From the source file, the notes are written in the staff they are. Therefore it is possible starting from a note to find out in which staff it belongs, only based on the text file.

Extracting the staff-number is done using the event-listener and the following snippet: #(define (get-staff-number key) (let* ((res (assoc key context-to-staff))) (if res (cdr res) ;; found (begin ;; not found, add it to list (let ((res next-staff-num)) (set! context-to-staff (cons (cons key res) context-to-staff)) (set! next-staff-num (+ 1 next-staff-num)) res))))) #(define (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver) (let* ((context (ly:translator-context source-engraver)) ... (root-context (object-address (ly:context-property-where-defined context 'instrumentName))) (staff-number (get-staff-number root-context)) ... )\n)) \\layout { \\context { \\Voice \\consists #(make-engraver (acknowledgers ((note-head-interface engraver grob source-engraver) (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver)))) }\n} The staff number is then exported in the notes file alongside the id of the note. The get-staff-number function simply assigns an incrementing number to each key it root-context it receives, starting from 0. That way, the first staff to be encountered will be labeled 0, the next one 1 and so forth. Each note having the same the same staff number are meant to be played by the same hand. It then becomes possible to display the keyboard and using different colours, to show which hands plays what. This is what the keyboard at the bottom of the introductory video shows : red coloured keys are pressed by the left hand blue coloured keys are pressed by the right one"},"finding_when_notes_are_played.html#extracting-when-a-note-is-played-and-for-how-long":{"title":"Extracting when a note is played, and for how long","id":"finding_when_notes_are_played.html#extracting-when-a-note-is-played-and-for-how-long","breadcrumbs":"Extracting when a note is played, and for how long","body":"One of the challenge was to find out when a note is played, and for how long. For example, on the following simple piece of music, simple music sheet the program must understand that: at the very beginning of the song, that is at \\( t=0s \\), a pianist must press the la key (aka a ). at \\( t=0.6s \\), a pianist must release the la key and simultaneously push the sol key down ( g ) at \\( t=1.2s \\), a pianist must release the sol key. To extract these pieces of information I used two features provided by Lilypond : the include-settings parameter, and the event listener. include-settings let the user include a file to set some global settings. That file is included before the score is processed. The event listener saves music events encountered during the music processing. For this simple music sheet simple music sheet , the generated music events are: 0.00000000\ttempo\t400.00000000\n0.00000000\tnote\t69\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 4 36\n0.25000000\tnote\t67\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 9 360.00000000\ttempo\t400.00000000\n0.00000000\tnote\t69\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 4 36\n0.25000000\tnote\t67\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 9 360.00000000\ttempo\t400.00000000\n0.00000000\tnote\t69\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 4 36\n0.25000000\tnote\t67\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 9 360.00000000\ttempo\t400.00000000\n0.00000000\tnote\t69\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 4 36\n0.25000000\tnote\t67\t4\t0.25000000\tpoint-and-click 9 36 That is with the default event-listener. Lilypond provides a way for the user to change that so more informations can be extracted. Out of this, we get that the tempo is 400. This 400 is almost the tempo we wrote. This 400 comes from the fact that we defined a tempo based on quarter note. The next line says that at \\( t = 0 \\) the key 69 (computer code for la ) is played for a quarter note. And a quarter note after the beginning, the note 67 (key code for sol ) is also played for a quarter note. There are some basic maths involved to get from these tempo and quarter timing into time a computer can use to understand when to start playing a note, and when to stop. One important thing to keep in mind though, is that the tempo can change during the music. These new tempos need to be taken into account when computing the time a note is played released."},"intro.html#lilyplayer":{"id":"intro.html#lilyplayer","body":"Lilyplayer plays piano music sheets. For a very quick overview of what it does, watch the following video: Demo The initial goal of the project was broader than simply that. At first, it was meant to be a full-featured piano learning app. For this project, I wanted to have the following features: Real music sheets Instead of boxes coming down the screen like synthesia , the application must display a real music sheet. The goal being to help learning piano, not to be a competitive game. Users must be able to use their own music sheets The application must not prevent the user from using any music sheet he wants. If the user bought a copy of some music sheet, he should be able to use it in the app. Therefore, the process of using a personal music sheet must be documented. Only one quality tolerated for the music sheets, the very best one. No one like to read music sheets scanned in so poor quality they appear pixelated on the screen. Also, the music sheet must look great on all screens, regarless of their dpi. Practice only a subpart of the music sheet No one learns a full music sheet right away. People practice on smaller parts at a time, and the app should let people do just that. Ability to play left and right hand separately It is often useful to practice the left and right hand part of a music separately. The app should not go into people's way of learning. Based on these requirements, it is no surprise that I decided to base my solution on top of lilypond . In their own words: LilyPond is a music engraving program, devoted to producing the highest-quality sheet music\npossible. It brings the aesthetics of traditionally engraved music to computer printouts. Lilypond's goal is to engrave music sheets. It takes a music description in a text format as input and generates a beautiful pdf as output. For this project this is simply not enough. To play music sheet, as showcased in the video above, more information needs to be retrieved. The rest of the document describes the challenges that appeared during the project, and how I overtook them (or not).","breadcrumbs":"Lilyplayer","title":"Lilyplayer"},"finding_bar_changes.html#finding-bar-changes-events":{"id":"finding_bar_changes.html#finding-bar-changes-events","title":"Finding bar changes events","body":"One of the required feature for the program was to be able to play only one part of the music, ... because people (at least beginners) learn a song one part at a time. A natural way to break a song into pieces is at measure boundary. Therefore the lilyplayer at to provide a way to play the music from some measure up to some other. this was visible in the introductory video at second 21. To find out when a measure starts and ends, I used the currentBarNumber from lilypond on the event-listener. On the event-listener, when getting notified of a note head, we retrieve the bar number and set it as part of its id. The code is as follow: #(define (on-note-head engraver grob source-engraver) (let* ((context (ly:translator-context source-engraver)) ... code to get the event ,,, (current-bar-number (ly:context-property context 'currentBarNumber)) (id ... former value t=with origin, start time, duration etc.)) (id-with-bar-number (ly:format \"#bar-number=~a~a\" current-bar-number id))) (ly:grob-set-property! grob 'id id-with-bar-number)\n)) \\layout { \\override NoteHead.stencil = #(lambda (grob) (let* ((note (ly:note-head::print grob)) (former-id (ly:grob-property-data grob 'id))) ... code to add the width and height of the note bounding box ...

Since we unfold the repeats to extract when notes are played, using the bar number as reported with unfolded repeat will lead to different values than what the user would see on the music sheet which contains repeats. That way, it is possible to know to which measure belongs a note. Detecting measure number change is as simple as checking two consecutively played notes and checking whether their measure number are the same or note. To then find out when a measure x starts, one just has to find the first played note with bar number x . Providing the user with the ability to play only from measure say 4 to 10 requires a bit more thought, in case there are repeats. For example, if measure 7 ends with a repeat returning to measure 2 and that this repeat is meant to be hit twice before moving to measure 8, what should the software play? measure 4 to 8 then 3 to 8 then 3 to 8 again then 9 and 10? measure 4 to 8 then 3 to 8 then 9 and 10? measure 4 to 8 then 9 and 10? Here the choice should probably be left to the user. Sadly lilyplayer doesn't let the user choose and decides to play the longest piece.","breadcrumbs":"Finding bar changes events"},"possible_improvements.html#anonymise-the-svg-files":{"body":"The svg files used in the lilydumper output are taken straight out from lilypond.

Compare the following two cursor progression below: cursor only around notes cursor going from top to bottom of the system cursor only wraps the notes cursor goes from top to bottom To find the top and bottom of a system, I used a debug option from lilypond: skylines. When passing the option -ddebug-skylines to lilypond, it generates some visual clues in the output which are normally used for debugging. On the following image, we can see some colored lines on top and bottom of the staves. simple example showing skylines There are two purple-ish lines, one on top of each staff, and two turquoise ones at the bottom. There are also two other lines which can't be seen as they are drawn below the top purple bottom turquoise ones. The top line that is not visible is red, and the bottom one is green. These are the top and bottom and bottom line of the system (which comprise only two staves in this example). When opening the generated svg file, we can see the following: <g color=\"rgb(0.0%, 25500.0%, 0.0%)\">\n<line transform=\"translate(5.6906, 3.8453)\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"0.1000\" stroke=\"currentColor\" x1=\"42.8096\" y1=\"8.0873\" x2=\"42.8096\" y2=\"8.0873\"/>\n...\n<line transform=\"translate(5.6906, 3.8453)\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"0.1000\" stroke=\"currentColor\" x1=\"42.8096\" y1=\"17.0373\" x2=\"42.8096\" y2=\"8.0873\"/>\n...\n<line transform=\"translate(5.6906, 3.8453)\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"0.1000\" stroke=\"currentColor\" x1=\"42.8096\" y1=\"17.0373\" x2=\"42.8096\" y2=\"17.0373\"/>\n...\n</g> Each line element inside a g group is a small segment of the g line. Using the translate and the x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 coordinates, we can reconstruct all the lines segment and thus the whole line. Using these coordinates it is then possible to compute the top most and bottom most segment, giving us the top and bottom of a line. The color in g element is then used to decide if the line is following the top or bottom of a staff, or the top of bottom of the system. Since we are interested here to fing the limits of a system, the lines that are of interest for us are the red ones (top system, color \"rgb(25500.0%, 0.0%, 0.0%)\") and green ones (bottom system, color \"rgb(0.0%, 25500.0%, 0.0%)\") Using these we can now extract all the top and bottom limits of the systems appearing in a music sheet. This is then later used as the top and bottom of the cursor as can be seen in the following example: top and bottom are now constant Since the goal of the project is to use real music sheets, the colored lines have to be removed. This is done simply by rerunning lilypond without the debug option. However, since running lilypond takes some time, it would very likely be faster to remove the colored lines out of the the svg files than re-running lilypond. I haven't implemented this optimisation yet."},"getting_the_cursor_wrapping_all_notes_belonging_to_a_chord.html#cursor-for-notes-in-a-chord":{"id":"getting_the_cursor_wrapping_all_notes_belonging_to_a_chord.html#cursor-for-notes-in-a-chord","body":"We saw how to find the top and bottom of a system, and how notes from the source file were linked to the music sheet. From that, getting the cursor for a chord is quite trivial: from the note file generated by the event listener, we deduce which notes are played at which time. All notes of a chord are by definition played at the same time. Therefore, notes being played at the same time are grouped together. From the note file, we extract the note id as the line and file number from their spot in the source file. From there, we find where these notes are on the music sheets. The cursor will then have as its left bound, the left-most limit of all notes in the chord. Similar for the right limit. To find the top and bottom limit, we then need to find in which system they are, which is trivially done by comparing coordinates. It can happen that the bottom of a system stays below than the top of the next system, which means in some cases, a note can look like it may belong to two different systems. Below is an example showing when these can possibly happen. highlight of system overlap The greyed area in the middle shows the overlap between the bottom of the top system and the top of the bottom system. It illustrates that looking only to top and bottom system coordinates are sometimes not enough to determine to which system a note belongs. However, for these notes, it is clear that using the full systems' skylines can be used to accurately determine which system is the right one. At this point, when playing the music, we can now also show the cursor ... and automatically scroll the page so that the cursor is always visible near the middle of the screen.","title":"Cursor for notes in a chord","breadcrumbs":"Finding where the cursor should be » Cursor for notes in a chord"}},"docInfo":{"possible_improvements.html#extract-the-several-data-in-parallel":{"body":30,"title":4,"breadcrumbs":4},"possible_improvements.html#possible-improvements":{"body":9,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"possible_improvements.html#optimise-the-svgs-to-avoid-wasting-space":{"breadcrumbs":5,"body":26,"title":5},"file_format.html#file-format":{"body":89,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"issue_with_repeats.html#repeats":{"body":384,"breadcrumbs":4,"title":1},"file_format.html#mapping-staff-number-instrument-name":{"title":5,"breadcrumbs":5,"body":75},"finding_the_staff_instrument_name.html#getting-the-staffs-instrument-name":{"title":4,"body":191,"breadcrumbs":4},"possible_improvements.html#crescendo--decrescendo--forte--pianissimo-":{"body":14,"title":4,"breadcrumbs":4},"computing_the_cursor_position.html#finding-where-the-cursor-position":{"body":43,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3},"file_format.html#the-events":{"breadcrumbs":1,"body":247,"title":1},"possible_improvements.html#avoid-changing-the-grob-ids-in-the-music-sheet":{"title":6,"body":72,"breadcrumbs":6},"finding_on_which_stave_a_note_is.html#finding-on-which-staff-a-note-is":{"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3,"body":282},"getting_the_cursor_wrapping_all_notes_belonging_to_a_chord.html#cursor-for-notes-in-a-chord":{"body":150,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":5},"finding_when_notes_are_played.html#extracting-when-a-note-is-played-and-for-how-long":{"breadcrumbs":4,"title":4,"body":249},"file_format.html#the-svgs-section":{"body":52,"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2},"possible_improvements.html#auto-include-the-source-file-into-the-output":{"breadcrumbs":5,"title":5,"body":11},"issue_with_tied_notes.html#issue-tied-notes":{"title":3,"breadcrumbs":6,"body":416},"matching_a_note_to_where_it_appears.html#matching-notes-to-where-they-appear-on-the-music-sheet":{"body":694,"breadcrumbs":7,"title":5},"possible_improvements.html#anonymise-the-svg-files":{"body":34,"breadcrumbs":3,"title":3},"possible_improvements.html#run-the-several-runs-of-lilypond-in-parallel":{"title":5,"breadcrumbs":5,"body":12},"intro.html#lilyplayer":{"body":198,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1},"issue_with_repeated_notes.html#separating-repeated-notes":{"breadcrumbs":6,"title":3,"body":154},"issue_with_overlapping_notes.html#fixing-overlapping-notes":{"title":3,"breadcrumbs":6,"body":93},"finding_turn_page_changes.html#finding-turn-page-events":{"body":94,"title":4,"breadcrumbs":4},"issue_with_grace_notes.html#issue-grace-notes":{"body":213,"breadcrumbs":6,"title":3},"file_format.html#the-header":{"breadcrumbs":1,"title":1,"body":37},"finding_systems_top_and_bottom.html#finding-the-top-and-bottom-of-systems":{"breadcrumbs":6,"title":4,"body":289},"possible_improvements.html#remove-the-skylines-automatically-and-grob-ids":{"breadcrumbs":5,"body":42,"title":5},"finding_bar_changes.html#finding-bar-changes-events":{"title":4,"breadcrumbs":4,"body":290}},"length":29}}};
